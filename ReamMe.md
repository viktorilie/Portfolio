/* Custom properties/variables  */
/* Set font size for easy rem calculations
     * default document font size = 16px, 1rem = 16px, 100% = 16px
     * (100% / 16px) * 10 = 62.5%, 1rem = 10px, 62.5% = 10px
    */


  /* A few media query to set some font sizes at different screen sizes.
   * This helps automate a bit of responsiveness.
   * The trick is to use the rem unit for size values, margin and padding.
   * Because rem is relative to the document font size
   * when we scale up or down the font size on the document
   * it will affect all properties using rem units for the values.
  */
  
  /* I am using the em unit for breakpoints
   * The calculation is the following
   * screen size divided by browser base font size
   * As an example: a breakpoint at 980px
   * 980px / 16px = 61.25em
  */
  
  /* 1200px / 16px = 75em */

  /* 980px / 16px = 61.25em */
